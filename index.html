		<strong>The best gaming PC is the one you're with and, to continue paraphrasing that old Stills' <br>song, if you can't build the one you love, then love the one you buy. Buying the best <br> gaming PC is the easiest way into PC gaming, and means you can forgo the potential <br> hassle of part-matching, tech-sourcing, and putting the whole damned thing together.

	<p>Alienware is a household name when it comes to gaming desktops that share a, shall <br> we say, unique aesthetic. While the extraterrestrial styling may not appeal to everyone, <br> their performance remains undeniable. The freshly minted Aurora R11 uses the same <br> compact design as its R9 forebear, our previous top pick, and means the new Intel 10th <br>Gen processors have found a home in Alienware's Aurora chassis. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Alienware has also updated its range with RTX 30-series offerings, giving you an easy <br> route into the Ampere generation of graphics cards.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are four different configurations of Comet Lake CPU to choose from: the Core i5 <br> 10400F, i7 10700, i7 10700K, and i9 10900. They're paired with Nvidia GPUs from the <br>GTX 1650 up to the unfeasibly expensive RTX 3090. That gives you a range of <br> Alienware gaming machines from affordable 1080p gaming right up to blistering 4K <br>workload-smashing performance, and the Alienware AIO cooling system will help keep <br>the cozy interior of the case at a reasonable temperature too.
